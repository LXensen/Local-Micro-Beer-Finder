	Name: "Earl Grey Marmalade Saison",
	Description: "tangy, floral, tart
				This is our reimagining of a rustic agrarian beer style from the French-speaking Wallonian region of southern Belgium. 
				Brewed with fresh zested oranges and Bridgehead organic Earl Grey tea, Dominion City Earl Grey Marmalade Saison pours a 
				distinctive rusty copper colour with a delicious bergamot aroma . Flavours include contrasting fruity, spicy and tart notes 
				with phenolic and fruity esters complementing a dry, moderately bitter finish. It all adds up to one deliciously unique and refreshing pint!",
